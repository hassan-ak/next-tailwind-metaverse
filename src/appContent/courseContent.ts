        model. Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in 
        modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, 
        microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach. These 
        techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined 
        with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably 
        with minimal toil. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and 
        management of containerized applications. In this course, you will learn how to develop cloud 
        applications using cloud-native technologies like Containers, Kubernetes, and CDK for Kubernetes.

        description: `Ambient computing, also commonly referred to as ubiquitous computing, is the 
        concept of blending computing power into our everyday lives in a way that is embedded into our 
        surroundings - invisible but useful. In a multi-device world, people don't want to spend their 
        life fussing with technology. An ambient approach gets the tech out of your way so you can live 
        your life while getting the help you need. It doesn't matter what device you're using, what 
        context you're in, whether you're talking, typing, or tapping. The technology in your life works 
        together seamlessly. Ambient computing uses all aspects of modern-day technology, including voice 
        assistants, artificial intelligence, sensors, connectivity, cloud computing and more. If you were 
        thinking that the IoT and ambient computing sound a lot alike, you aren't wrong; the two concepts 
        are intertwined. IoT refers to the vast array of devices that connect to the internet to optimize 
        their functionality, like smart sensors and smart speakers: ambient computing builds on that. 
        Ambient computing focuses on the interaction between these devices once they are connected. Matter, 
        the next-generation smart home standard, solves many smart home pain points while bringing all our 
        IoT devices together. Some of the biggest tech companies are working together to make Matter a 
        unified protocol for future smart homes. These companies include Apple, Amazon, and Google. This 
        means Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, Google Nest, and Samsung SmartThings will 
        support the Matter standard by default for all new devices. In this course we will learn to build 
        smart homes with Amazon Alexa and Matter protocol.
